synopsis: "Solver for semidefinite programming problems"
description: """
CSDP is a library of routines that implements a predictor corrector variant of
the semidefinite programming algorithm. It is written in C for efficiency and runs
in parallel on shared memory multi-processor systems.
See also the conf-csdp opam package (for distributions that provide csdp)
